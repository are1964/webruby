Preparing the Core Ruby participants for the web

RubyLearning.org is planning a free, online course on topics that hopefully will help those that have some knowledge of Ruby programming to get started with web programming - call it "Intermediate Ruby Programming". This does not cover Ruby on Rails. 

The course material is under preparation and I am looking for help from you to help create - add / subtract / modify the topics and material for this course. 

The course is scheduled for 7th Jan. 2012 and we would have 3-4 mentors helping out the participants during the course. 

Can you help?
